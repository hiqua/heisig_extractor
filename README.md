# Goal

Get entries such as:
```
æ³³;swim;water, eternity;The eternal bliss of children swimming in water.
```

using the .epub of Remember the Kanji by Heisig, to easily make flashcards out
of them (e.g. using Anki).

* kanji
* key
* word
* Heisig story
* primitive meaning
* stroke order
* (currently missing) primitive elements (found in the kanji)

Could also be nice to get the primitives.

# Notes

* can deobfuscate fonts using Sigil (just untick the deobfuscation) then
  export fonts

# Status

* I wrote this until I got a decent result for my use-case. Given that it's
  basically a one-off (this code is useless once you got your CSV / flashcards
  out of it), there was no reason for me to polish it further.
